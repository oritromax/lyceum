# Units of work

A unit is one piece of change work. It lives in one plan file and on one branch. Inspect
commands (`understand`, `trace`, `audit`) are not units: they have no branch, plan or gates.

## Unit types

| Type | Started by | Purpose | Merges into the spec at close |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feat` | `lyceum add feat [title]` | New behaviour | Always |
| `bug` | `lyceum add bug [title]` | File a bug and run the full fix cycle | Only when the spec was silent or wrong: adds an edge case or AC |
| `refactor` | `lyceum refactor [title]` | Change structure, never behaviour | Citations only |
| `chore` | `lyceum chore [title]` | Maintenance: dependency updates, README, config | Never |
| `doc` | `lyceum add doc [title]` | A human doc under `docs/` | Never |
| `test` | `lyceum add test [title]` | Describe one test case; the agent picks its level and writes it | Never |

Bare `lyceum add` offers the four `add` types. With no title, the agent's interview asks for one.

## The plan file

`lyceum/plan/<hash>-<slug>.md`. It is the unit: there is no other unit state.

```yaml

---
## What and why          (agent: summary of the change; points at the spec delta, never copies the spec)
## Spec delta            (agent: which areas and ACs changed; the change itself is written in the area files)
## Steps                 (agent: ordered chunks, each with the ACs it proves)
## Progress              (agent: per step, done / in progress / not started, with run references)
## Log                   (agent: decisions made and owner input received during the unit)
```

Body sections follow the plan shape set by the owner: explain the feature, which files change, a summary
of progress, and documenting it in the spec (plan discussion).

**Ownership:** the CLI alone writes the CLI-owned fields. If `check` sees a CLI-owned field change
without a matching event, that is a bypass.
`check` finds the current unit through the log as well as the plan: if the current branch matches an `add` event's
`branch` but no plan claims it, or the plan's fields disagree, that is a finding, never "no unit".

## Gate lists (fixed per type)

`M` = mechanical (clears on a CLI-recorded run). `J` = judgment (clears by owner approval).

| Type | Gates in order |
|---|---|
| `feat` | `spec` J (interview → spec delta + ACs + plan, drafted together and approved in one stop; brownfield adds as-built sections for missing areas) → `build` (steps) → `verify` M (full suite passes, every new AC mapped to a test) → `close` |
| `bug` | `repro` M (test-first: a new test fails before any fix exists) → `diagnose` (root cause written in the plan) → `fix` → `verify` M (repro test passes and the full suite passes) → `cause` J: `approve cause` on the branch, hashing the root cause and the fix diff together, before the PR → `close`. A spec AC the bug adds is written into its area file (and the registry range) before `approve cause`, which hashes that area file. Untestable bugs: `approve cause --no-repro "<reason>"` at `repro` records the reason and skips `repro` only; the bug moves to `diagnose`, and `verify` and the final `cause` J are still required. No plan gate |
| `refactor` | `intent` J (what, into what, why, plus a metric if the goal is performance) → `baseline` M (the full suite passes on the start commit; if coverage is thin, characterization tests are added first, and the owner approves them J) → `plan` J → `build` (steps; each step runs a subset and stays green, never clearing a gate) → `verify` M (full suite passes; test files are unchanged since the baseline or every diff is owner-approved J; benchmark if the goal is performance) → `close` |
| `chore` | Two tiers. **Trivial:** `build` → `close`, with no up-front gate; `check` fails the branch if its diff touches code, a manifest, a lockfile or CI config without an approved plan. **Planned:** `lyceum plan` moves the chore to `plan` J → `build` → `verify` M (full suite passes) → `close` |
| `doc` | `draft` → `verify` M (the branch diff has only non-code files, and the full suite passes or the project has no tests at all; running the commands the doc shows is the agent's job in the doc skill) → `close`. No human gate |
| `test` | `write` → `run` M (the new test passes) → `close`. No human gate. If the new test fails on current code, the unit stops and offers conversion to `bug` with the test as the repro |

**Conditional approvals:** refactor's characterization-test approval (inside `baseline`) and test-diff approval
(inside `verify`) are conditions on those gates, not separate gates. The gate does not clear until the required
approval is recorded.

**Status transitions.** The CLI moves `status` only at these points: `planned` → `in-progress` when the
unit's code-opening gate clears (for doc and test units, which have none, when the unit is added); `in-progress` →
`implemented` when `verify` (or test's `run`) passes; `implemented` → `closed` at `close`. A trivial chore is
`in-progress` from `add`. Each move is recorded in the event that caused it (`status` field).

**Code-opening gate:** `spec` for feat, `repro` for bug (or its `--no-repro` skip), `plan` for refactor and
planned chore. Test files written during bug `repro` or refactor `baseline` are allowed before it.

**The floor:** every type that changes application code passes through an approved `plan` or `spec`/`intent` gate and a mechanical
`verify` before it can close. `bug` meets the floor through the
mechanical `repro` gate plus the `cause` approval. `doc` and `test` change only docs or tests and have mechanical gates only.

## Refactor boundaries

- If a refactor turns out to need a behaviour change (a bug, an edge case, an interface change), the agent stops
  and splits it out as `add bug` or `add feat`. A refactor PR never contains a behaviour change.
- Changing a public surface (API route, CLI flag, exported function, DB schema) needs explicit owner approval, or
  the unit is reclassified as `feat`. The plan lists each change under `public_surface:` (agent field) and
  `approve plan` hashes them with the plan. Spotting a public-surface change is the agent's job; the CLI cannot
  detect one in an arbitrary language. `verify` refuses when `public_surface:` changed after `approve plan`.

## Close

`lyceum close [unit]`:
1. Requires the unit's last gate before `close` cleared: `verify` for feat, refactor and planned chore and doc,
   `cause` for bug, `run` for test. A trivial chore needs nothing but `check` passing its diff.
2. For `feat`, checks that every area the plan's `## Spec delta` names is in the `spec` approval's hashed files.
   The spec text was written into the area files at the `spec` gate and approved there, so `close` copies nothing.
For `refactor`, refuses any spec diff other than `cites:` frontmatter.
3. If TESTING.md changed in this unit, refuses until the owner re-runs `approve testing`.
4. Sets status `closed`, writes a `close` event and commits the plan with it. The plan file stays as history.
5. With `gh` installed and a GitHub remote, runs `gh pr create` from the unit branch to the base branch;
   `glab` likewise for GitLab. Otherwise it prints the exact push and merge commands. The merge itself is the
   owner's, and git history records it; no merge event is written.

A **test unit whose test fails**: `close` converts it to a bug instead of closing it. It writes an `add`
event for a new bug unit on the same branch with the failing test recorded as the repro, so the bug starts past
`repro` at `diagnose`, and a `close` event for the test unit with `converted_to: <bug id>`.

For `bug`, `close` requires the `cause` approval. For `feat`, the PR merge carries no extra approval: its judgment gates are already recorded.

## Amend

`lyceum amend [unit] "<reason>"` reopens an approved plan mid-build:
1. Invalidates the approval of the unit's code-opening gate (`spec` for feat, `plan` for refactor and planned chore)
   and every later approval, and moves the gate back to it; status goes back to `planned`. A refactor's `intent`
   stays approved; `amend --intent "<reason>"` goes back to `intent` instead, for when the intent itself changed.
2. Writes an `amend` event (`unit`, `gate`, `reason`, `invalidated`, `status`) and appends the reason to the plan's
   `## Log`.
3. `check` then fails new code changes until the owner re-approves that gate.
Working out what the change touches (areas, ACs, tests, steps) is the agent's job, guided by the skill. A bug has
no plan to amend: `amend` on a bug refuses and points at `add bug` for a new cause.

## Plan command

`lyceum plan` shows the current unit's plan. `lyceum plan --new-area <name>` registers a new area after printing
the existing ones. When `lyceum/spec/<name>.md` already exists with no registry row, it registers that file and
leaves it unchanged. The agent writes registry rows and AC ranges; `check` validates them. `lyceum plan` on a trivial chore upgrades it to a planned chore and moves it to `plan` J.
Re-planning an approved unit is `amend`; there is no `plan --edit`.

## Starting refactor and chore units

`lyceum refactor "<title>"` and `lyceum chore "<title>"` start a unit exactly as `add` does (ID, branch, plan
file, `add` event); a refactor starts at `intent`, a chore as a trivial chore at `build`.

## Roadmap

`lyceum/LIBRARY.md` is the ordered list of likely next units. The agent keeps it and reorders it freely; nothing
hashes it and the owner never approves it. Each entry is one list item, `- <type>: <title>`, optionally followed by
` (AC12, AC13)` naming the ACs it will claim. When no unit is in flight and nothing is pending, `status` prints the top
entry as its `Next:` line (`lyceum add feat "<title>"`, or `lyceum refactor` / `lyceum chore` for those types).

## Concurrency

- Parallel work happens on other branches or other clones, never in one checkout.
- `add` and `close` read `lyceum/plan/` on other local and remote-tracking branches with `git show`, and warn when
  another open unit names the same area. They never block.
- Spec conflicts are resolved in git like any other conflict.

## Interviews

Interview length scales with the change; when the request already answers everything, the agent asks nothing and drafts. Every skill that interviews uses one format: numbered questions, lettered options, recommended option first,
then the agent stops and waits. Where the harness has a structured-question tool, the skill uses it instead.
Interview rules from the source method apply: never ask what the request already answers, options are
concrete alternatives, at most two clarification rounds per document, anything still open becomes
`[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`.

**Checkpoints.** The owner's brief is kept verbatim, because a brief sent over several messages is otherwise lost
to the chat. `init`, `feat`, `bug` and `doc` open and close their interviews with a checkpoint:

- **Opening.** Before any question, the agent saves the owner's raw brief word for word and appends each further
  message to it: at greenfield `init` to `lyceum/spec/brief.md`, in a unit to a `## Brief` section of its plan. A
  first reply may be the first of several. The agent then asks once "Anything to add, or shall I proceed?" and asks
  numbered questions only after the owner says proceed.
- **Closing.** Once the drafts are written and before the owner is handed the unit's approval (`init`: `lyceum
  approve project`; `feat`: `approve spec`; `bug`: `approve cause`), the agent asks "Anything to add, or shall I
  consider the spec ready?". Each addition is appended to the brief, the area files, ACs and plan are updated, and
  the question is asked again; the approve command is given only once the owner says ready. A doc unit has no
  approval: its closing checkpoint asks "…shall I consider the doc ready?" before `lyceum test`, and "ready" lets
  the agent run it.
- **Ready is not approval.** "Ready" only lets the agent hand over the approve command. Under
  `approvals.harness_prompt: allow` the agent still runs `lyceum approve` only on a separate request from the owner.
- **Late additions.** Additions after the interview skip the two-round limit: they go straight into the area files
  and plan, and anything still uncertain becomes `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]`.
- **Provenance.** Spec text not stated in the brief is marked `[DERIVED: …]` or `[AGENT-PROPOSED: …]`, so the
  markers can be checked against the brief.

The brief is frozen with what it led to: `brief.md` is a registered area, so `approve project` hashes it with the
other area files, and a plan's `## Brief` is in the plan hash of `approve spec` and `approve cause`. A doc plan is
hashed by no approval. After `project`, a unit's brief goes in its plan, never in `brief.md`.
The brief is not an AC-bearing area: it defines no AC whatever it quotes, and it does not count as an area for the
project gate, which is pending only once another area is registered. [DERIVED: `approve project` refuses with only
`brief` registered, as it does with none, so AC38's "at least one area" cannot be met by the brief alone]

**After a gate clears.** Any question about whether to proceed is a structured yes/no (yes starts the next
step, no opens a discussion), never an open prose question. The next step is the one `status` prints.

## Brownfield spec growth

When a plan names an area that has no spec file, the `spec` gate (feat) or `plan` gate (refactor, chore) first
has the agent write that area's as-built section from the code, citing files and starting from a matching
`understand` record if one exists. The owner approves it together with the plan. Untouched areas stay unspecified.

## Greenfield

`init` on an empty project runs the project interview and writes the initial `lyceum/spec/<area>.md` files,
with the owner's brief in `lyceum/spec/brief.md` registered as area `brief` (see "Checkpoints"), approved together as gate `project` J. At greenfield the agent writes the area registry rows in `lyceum/SPEC.md`
itself, since no unit exists yet; `approve project` hashes `SPEC.md` with the area files. After that only the CLI
changes the registry (`plan --new-area`). The first slice of work is then an `add feat`. Security, deploy and UI
are optional areas.

## Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion |
|---|---|
| AC15 | Given bare `lyceum add`, when it runs interactively, then it offers exactly `feat`, `bug`, `doc`, `test` |
| AC16 | Given `add feat`, when it completes, then the plan has `status: planned`, `gate: spec`, and an `add` event exists in `events.jsonl` |
| AC106 | Given a `feat` whose spec delta and plan are drafted, when the owner runs `approve spec` once, then the build gate opens and the event hashes the plan and every named area file; no separate `approve plan` is required |
| AC107 | Given a bug at `repro` with no repro test, when the owner runs `approve cause --no-repro "visual only"`, then `repro` is skipped, the event records the reason, the bug moves to `diagnose`, and `verify` (full-suite pass) and the final `approve cause` are still required before `close` |
| AC17 | Given a plan, when any CLI-owned frontmatter field differs from what the event log implies, then `check` reports a bypass naming the field |
| AC18 | Given a `feat` at gate `spec`, when `lyceum test` passes, then the gate does not change (judgment gates never clear on runs) |
| AC19 | Given a `feat` with `spec` and `plan` approved and the steps built, when `lyceum test` runs the full suite and it passes and every new AC ID is found in a test, then `verify` clears and a `gate-clear` event with the run inlined is written |
| AC20 | Given a `feat` at `verify`, when the full suite passes but AC17 is not found in any test, then `verify` does not clear and the output names AC17 |
| AC21 | Given an `add bug` at `repro`, when the agent's new test is run by the CLI at HEAD, with a branch diff that touches only test files, and fails, then `repro` clears with no human approval |
| AC22 | Given an `add bug` at `repro`, when the new test passes at HEAD, with a branch diff that touches only test files, then `repro` does not clear and the output says the test does not reproduce the bug |
| AC23 | Given a `bug` unit, when it reaches `close`, then no `plan` approval was ever required |
| AC24 | Given a `refactor` at `baseline`, when the full suite fails on the start commit, then `baseline` does not clear |
| AC25 | Given a `refactor` that passed `baseline`, when a test file's assertions change and the owner has not approved that diff, then `verify` does not clear and the diff is shown |
| AC26 | Given a `refactor` step, when the agent runs `lyceum test changed`, then a run is recorded and no gate clears |
| AC27 | Given a `refactor` whose stated goal is performance, when `intent` is approved without a metric in the plan, then the CLI refuses the approval and names the missing metric |
| AC28 | Given a `chore` branch whose diff touches only `*.md` files, when `check --ci` runs, then it passes with no plan approval |
| AC29 | Given a `chore` branch whose diff touches `package.json`, when `check --ci` runs and no approved plan exists, then it fails |
| AC30 | Given an `add test` unit, when the new test fails against current code, then the agent stops and offers conversion to `add bug` and the test file is unchanged |
| AC31 | Given `close` on a `feat`, when it completes, then every area the plan names was in the `spec` approval's hashed files, the plan has `status: closed`, and a `close` event exists |
| AC32 | Given `close` on a `refactor`, when the area file's diff includes anything other than `cites:` frontmatter, then `close` refuses |
| AC33 | Given `close` when TESTING.md changed in the unit and is not re-approved, then `close` refuses and names `approve testing` |
| AC34 | Given `close` with `gh` installed and a GitHub remote, then a PR is opened; given no `gh`, then the exact next command is printed |
| AC35 | Given `amend` on a unit at `build`, when it completes, then the affected approvals are marked invalid, the gate moves back, and `check` fails new code changes until re-approval |
| AC36 | Given another branch with an open unit naming area `orders`, when `add` creates a unit and the plan names `orders`, then a warning names that branch and the command still succeeds |
| AC37 | Given a plan naming an area not in the registry, when the plan gate is approved, then the approval is refused and the output lists existing areas and `--new-area` |
| AC38 | Given `init` on an empty directory, when the project interview completes and the owner approves `project`, then at least one `lyceum/spec/<area>.md` exists and is registered in `lyceum/SPEC.md` |
| AC100 | Given a `refactor` unit, when the agent finds a needed behaviour change, then it stops, offers `add bug` or `add feat`, and the refactor branch's diff contains no test assertion change the owner has not approved and no change to spec behaviour text |
| AC102 | Given a `bug` with `verify` cleared and no `approve cause` event, when `check --ci` runs on its branch, then it fails and names `approve cause`; after the owner approves, the event hashes the plan and every file in the fix diff |
| AC101 | Given a `refactor` whose plan's `public_surface:` list changed after `approve plan`, when `verify` would clear, then it does not clear and the output names the re-approval |
| AC124 | Given a test unit whose test fails, when `close` runs, then the test unit is closed with `converted_to`, a bug unit exists on the same branch with that test as its repro, and the bug is at `diagnose` |
| AC125 | Given a unit whose last pre-close gate is not cleared, when `close` runs, then it refuses and names that gate |
| AC126 | Given `close` with no `gh` or `glab` or no remote, then it prints the push and merge commands and writes no merge event |
| AC127 | Given `lyceum refactor "Split parser"`, then a refactor unit exists at `intent` on a `refactor/` branch; given `lyceum chore "Bump deps"`, then a chore unit exists at `build` |
| AC128 | Given `lyceum plan` on a trivial chore, then it moves to `plan` and `check` requires the plan approval before code |
| AC129 | Given a doc unit whose branch diff touches a code file, when `lyceum test` passes, then `verify` does not clear and names the file |
| AC130 | Given a refactor with `intent` approved, when the agent writes `## Steps` and `public_surface:` and `check` runs, then there is no approval-integrity finding; when `## What and why` or `goal:` changes, then `check` names the `intent` approval |
| AC131 | Given a refactor at `build`, when `amend --intent "<reason>"` runs, then `intent` and every later approval are invalidated and the gate is `intent`; without `--intent`, `intent` still counts and the gate is `plan` |
| AC132 | Given a project where no file matches `test_files` and a doc unit at `verify` whose diff has no code, when `lyceum test` runs, then `verify` clears with `no_tests: true`; given the same with a code file in the diff, then it refuses and names the file; a feat in the same project still refuses |
| AC154 | Given `lyceum/spec/billing.md` exists and no registry row names it, when `plan --new-area billing` runs, then the row is added, the file is unchanged, and the command does not refuse |
| AC155 | Given no unit in flight, nothing pending, and `lyceum/LIBRARY.md` whose first entry is `- feat: CSV export`, when `status` runs, then `Next:` is `lyceum add feat "CSV export"` |
| AC156 | Given AC9 in an area file, no closed plan listing it in `acs:` and no LIBRARY.md entry naming it, when `check --ci` runs, then a warning names AC9 and the exit code is unaffected by it |
| AC168 | Given a chore moved to `plan` by `lyceum plan` and its plan approved, when the build is committed and `lyceum test` passes, then `verify` clears and `close` succeeds; until `verify` clears, `close` refuses |
| AC185 | Given the `lyceum-init` skill, then its greenfield section says to save the owner's brief verbatim to `lyceum/spec/brief.md` before any question, to append each further message to it, and that a first reply may be the first of several |
| AC186 | Given the `lyceum-init` skill, then it says to ask once "Anything to add, or shall I proceed?" after saving the brief, and to ask numbered questions only after the owner says proceed |
| AC187 | Given the `lyceum-init` skill, then it says to ask "Anything to add, or shall I consider the spec ready?" after the area files are written and before giving `lyceum approve project`, to append each addition to `brief.md`, update the areas and ACs and ask again, and to give the approve command only after the owner says ready |
| AC188 | Given the `lyceum-init`, `lyceum-feat` and `lyceum-bug` skills, then each says "ready" only allows handing over the approve command and is not an approval, and that running `lyceum approve` under `approvals.harness_prompt: allow` still needs a separate request from the owner |
| AC189 | Given the `lyceum-init`, `lyceum-feat`, `lyceum-bug` and `lyceum-doc` skills, then each says additions after the interview skip the two-round limit, go straight into the spec or plan, and leave any remaining uncertainty as `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` |
| AC190 | Given the `lyceum-init` skill, then it says to register `brief.md` in the area registry of `lyceum/SPEC.md` as area `brief` |
| AC191 | Given a greenfield project whose registry lists `spec/brief.md` and one other area, when the owner runs `approve project`, then the event hashes `lyceum/spec/brief.md`; when `brief.md` is then edited and committed, then `check` reports an approval-integrity finding naming it |
| AC192 | Given the `lyceum-init`, `lyceum-feat` and `lyceum-bug` skills, then each says to mark spec text the brief does not state as `[DERIVED: …]` or `[AGENT-PROPOSED: …]`, naming the brief (`brief.md` or the plan's `## Brief`) as the reference |
| AC193 | Given the `lyceum-feat`, `lyceum-bug` and `lyceum-doc` skills, then each says to save the owner's brief verbatim to a `## Brief` section of the plan before any question, append each further message, that a first reply may be the first of several, and to ask once "Anything to add, or shall I proceed?" before numbered questions |
| AC194 | Given the `lyceum-feat` and `lyceum-bug` skills, then each says to ask "Anything to add, or shall I consider the spec ready?" before giving its approve command (`lyceum approve spec`, `lyceum approve cause`), to append each addition to `## Brief`, update the spec and plan and ask again, and to give the command only after the owner says ready |
| AC195 | Given the `lyceum-doc` skill, then it says to ask "Anything to add, or shall I consider the doc ready?" before running `lyceum test`, to append each addition to `## Brief` and update the doc and ask again, and that a doc has no approval, so "ready" lets the agent run `lyceum test` |
| AC196 | Given `lyceum/spec/brief.md` quoting an AC table row or an AC bullet led by the bold ID, then it defines no AC (no registry, unclaimed or coverage entry, and no file for an AC's lookup); and given a greenfield registry listing only `brief`, then `project` is not pending and `approve project` refuses, until another area is registered [DERIVED: the refusal and the lookups ignoring it follow from "ACs aren't read from brief.md" and "brief doesn't count as an area for the project gate"] |
