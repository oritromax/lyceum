# Lyceum: specification index

**Status: v1**, the first public version. Decisions from v1 on are logged in `decisions.md`.

Lyceum is a spec-driven software development lifecycle for agentic coding. It ships as one CLI
(`lyceum`) plus skills that any agent harness can load. The CLI keeps state and proves evidence. The agent
interviews, drafts and builds. Only the human approves.

## How to read this spec

- This file is the index. Load an area file only when the work needs it.
- Acceptance criteria are numbered globally (`AC1`, `AC2`, …). Numbers are never reused, and withdrawn ACs
  stay in place, marked withdrawn. Tests cite AC IDs literally.
- Markers:

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` | A decision the owner still owes. Nothing that depends on it is built |
| `[DERIVED: Dn]` | Inferred from the cited decisions rather than stated in them. Confirm at the gate |
| `[AGENT-PROPOSED: …]` | Added by the drafter with no decision behind it. Accept or strike at the gate |
| `[TBD until <x>]` | Deliberately deferred to a known later step |

## Area registry

In projects that use Lyceum the agent writes this table and `check` validates it. Here it lists Lyceum's own spec areas.
