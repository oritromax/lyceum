title: Units and gates
description: Each piece of work is a unit with one plan file, one branch and a fixed list of gates.
---

A **unit** is one piece of change work. It lives in one plan file, `lyceum/plan/<hash>-<slug>.md`, and on one branch. The plan file is the unit: there is no other unit state.

Inspect commands (`understand`, `trace`, `audit`) are not units: they have no branch, plan or gates.

## Unit types

| Type | Started by | Purpose | Merges into the spec at close |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feat` | `lyceum add feat [title]` | New behaviour | Always |
| `bug` | `lyceum add bug [title]` | File a bug and run the full fix cycle | Only when the spec was silent or wrong: adds an edge case or AC |
| `refactor` | `lyceum refactor [title]` | Change structure, never behaviour | Citations only |
| `chore` | `lyceum chore [title]` | Maintenance: dependency updates, README, config | Never |
| `doc` | `lyceum add doc [title]` | A human doc under `docs/` | Never |
| `test` | `lyceum add test [title]` | Describe one test case; the agent picks its level and writes it | Never |

## IDs and branches

A unit ID is 6 random lowercase hex characters plus a slug derived from the title, for example `a3f9c2-csv-export`. Each unit has its own branch. The prefix follows the type: `feat/`, `fix/` (for `bug`), `refactor/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `test/`, then the unit ID. A checkout has at most one unit in flight.

## Two kinds of gate

- **Judgment** gates clear by owner approval: `lyceum approve <gate>`. See [Approvals](/concepts/approvals/).
- **Mechanical** gates clear on a test run the CLI executed and recorded: `lyceum test`. See [Acceptance criteria and evidence](/concepts/acceptance-criteria/).

Work steps (`build`, `diagnose`, `fix`, `draft`, `write`) end when the next mechanical gate clears.

## Gate lists

Gate lists are fixed per type. There are no custom gate lists per unit.

| Type | Gates in order |
|---|---|
| `feat` | `spec` (judgment) → `build` → `verify` (mechanical) → `close` |
| `bug` | `repro` (mechanical) → `diagnose` → `fix` → `verify` (mechanical) → `cause` (judgment) → `close` |
| `refactor` | `intent` (judgment) → `baseline` (mechanical) → `plan` (judgment) → `build` → `verify` (mechanical) → `close` |
| `chore`, trivial | `build` → `close` |
| `chore`, planned | `plan` (judgment) → `build` → `verify` (mechanical) → `close` |
| `doc` | `draft` → `verify` (mechanical) → `close` |
| `test` | `write` → `run` (mechanical) → `close` |

### Feature

The `spec` gate covers the interview, the spec change, its acceptance criteria and the plan, drafted together and approved in one stop. `verify` needs the full suite to pass and every new acceptance criterion mapped to a test.

### Bug

The test comes first, and you approve after the fix, not before. At `repro` the agent writes a test that fails because of the bug, commits it, and runs `lyceum test --repro <test>`; the gate clears only if the test fails. The agent writes the root cause in the plan, then fixes the bug. `verify` needs the repro test and the full suite to pass. `lyceum approve cause` hashes the root cause and the fix diff together.

If no automated test can reproduce the bug, the agent explains why and stops. Only you can skip `repro`:

```sh
lyceum approve cause --no-repro "<reason>"
```

`verify` and `cause` are still required. A code commit after `verify` sends the bug back to `fix`.

### Refactor

You approve the intent and the plan. The full suite must pass on the start commit (`baseline`) and again at `verify`. If coverage is thin, characterization tests are added first, and you approve them. Any change to a test file after the baseline needs your approval with `lyceum approve tests`. If a refactor turns out to need a behaviour change, the agent stops and splits it out as a bug or feature.

### Chore

A trivial chore has no gates, but `check` fails one whose diff touches code, a manifest, a lockfile or CI config. `lyceum plan` upgrades it to a planned chore that you approve.

### Doc

Documentation only. No approval; the branch may change only non-code files.

### Test

Nothing needs your approval. If the new test fails on the current code, the unit stops and the agent offers to turn it into a bug. `lyceum close` then starts a bug at `diagnose`, with the test as its repro.

## The code-opening gate

Each type that changes application code has one gate that opens code: `spec` for feat, `repro` for bug (or its `--no-repro` skip), `plan` for refactor and planned chore. Until it clears, the harness hook blocks code writes and `check` flags code in the branch diff. Test files written during bug `repro` or refactor `baseline` are allowed before it.

## Status

The CLI moves `status` only at these points:

- `planned` → `in-progress` when the unit's code-opening gate clears (for doc and test units, when the unit is added; a trivial chore is `in-progress` from the start).
- `in-progress` → `implemented` when `verify` (or test's `run`) passes.
- `implemented` → `closed` at `close`.

## Close

`lyceum close` requires the unit's last gate before `close` to have cleared. It sets the status to `closed` and writes a `close` event; the plan file stays as history. With an origin remote it then pushes the unit branch, never forced: to its upstream, or with `-u` when it has none. `close` is the only command that pushes. With `gh` installed and a GitHub remote it then opens a pull request (`glab` likewise for GitLab); otherwise it prints the pull request step and the merge commands. If the push fails, the unit stays closed, no pull request is opened, and it prints the push and pull request commands to run. The merge itself is yours.

## Amend

`lyceum amend "<reason>"` reopens an approved plan mid-build. It invalidates the approval of the unit's code-opening gate and every later approval, and moves the gate back to it. `check` then fails new code changes until you re-approve. A bug has no plan to amend.

## The plan file

The CLI alone writes `id`, `type`, `branch`, `status`, `gate` and `approvals` in the plan's frontmatter. The agent writes the rest, including `files:` (the planned scope) and `acs:` (the acceptance criteria the unit adds). The body has `What and why`, `Spec delta`, `Steps`, `Progress` and `Log` sections.
